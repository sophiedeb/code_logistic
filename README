Logistic models

This code produces the results of "Stochastic logistic models reproduce experimental time series of microbial communities".

The notebook Figures_eLife.ipynb contains all the figures of the main manuscript. It calls the following pyton files:

key code to generate the time series: generate_timeseries.py (main) + noise_parameters.py (very short technical code)
 
codes for time series analysis: neutral_covariance_test.py, neutrality_analysis.py, noise_analysis.py, noise_color_analysis.py


technical code for plotting: elife_settings.py, noise_properties_plotting.py, make_colormap.py

and load the experimental data contained in the "Data" folder. Because simulations take a long time, we also provide files with saved simulations results (in the folder "results"). To reproduce those results, we need to use ... (to be done).
